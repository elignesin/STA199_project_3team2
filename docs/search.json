Correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. By calculating the correlation coefficient, we were able to identify which factors were the most highly associated with life expectancy.\nThe highest correlated variables are HIV/AIDs, Income Composition of Resources, and Schooling, which have correlation coefficients of -0.59, 0.72, and 0.73, respectively. The HIV/AIDs variable measures the deaths per 1,000 live births due to HIV/AIDS in a given year, the Income Composition of Resources variable is a score between 0 and 1 that measures how well a country utilizes its resources in a given year, and the Schooling variable is the number of years of schooling people in a country have on average in a given year.\nSince we found that HIV/AIDs, Income Composition of Resources, and Schooling are the variables that are highest correlated with our response variable of life expectancy, we chose these variables to perform exploratory data analysis on.\nExploratory Data Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nICOR: As shown, there is a positive linear correlation between the ICOR score and life expectancy, and this relationship is true for developing and developed countries. In other words, as the ICOR score increases, the life expectancy increases in a linear manner for both developing and developed countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nHIV/AIDS: As shown, there is a negative correlation between HIV/AIDS deaths per 1,000 births and life expectancy for developing countries. In other words, as HIV/AIDS deaths decrease, life expectancy increases, The graph also indicates that there is a low HIV/AIDS mortality in developed countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchooling: As shown, there is a positive linear correlation between the years of schooling and life expectancy, and this relationship is true for developing and developed countries. In other words, as the number of years of schooling increases, the life expectancy increases in a linear manner for both developing and developed countries.\nFitting Models\nUtilizing the explanatory analysis we conducted, we decided to fit a linear regression model to determine how predictive our selected factors, as well as country development status, were of life expectancy. We chose to fit a linear model based on the largely linear trends we saw between our chosen variables and life expectancy during exploratory data analysis. We fitted an additive model along with an interactive model. The additive model makes the assumption that all the factors have independent effects on life expectancy. For the interactive model, we chose to make the interactive term between Income Composition of Resources and country development status because these two variables are the most closely related to each other out of all the factors, and one is likely to influence the other.\nAdditive model:\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n  term                            estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;                              &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)                       48.6      0.749      64.9  0        \n2 Schooling                          1.19     0.0629     19.0  7.19e- 73\n3 HIV.AIDS                          -0.631    0.0180    -35.1  4.14e-202\n4 Income.composition.of.resources   13.9      0.939      14.8  1.89e- 46\n5 StatusDeveloping                  -1.45     0.347      -4.18 3.09e-  5\n\n\n\\[\\begin{gather*}\n\\widehat{LifeExpectancy} = 48.56 + 1.195 * schooling - 0.63 * HIV/AIDS \\\\ +  13.867 * ICOR - 1.45 * status\\\\\nstatus =\n  \\begin{cases}\n    1 & \\text{if Developing Country}\\\\\n    0 & \\text{if Developed Country}\n  \\end{cases}\n\\end{gather*}\\]\nInteractive model:\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  term                                    estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                      &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)                               33.1      4.37        7.58 5.95e- 14\n2 Schooling                                  1.16     0.0633     18.4  1.24e- 68\n3 HIV.AIDS                                  -0.633    0.0179    -35.3  5.26e-204\n4 StatusDeveloping                          14.3      4.42        3.24 1.20e-  3\n5 Income.composition.of.resources           32.9      5.40        6.10 1.35e-  9\n6 StatusDeveloping:Income.composition.of…  -19.0      5.31       -3.58 3.49e-  4\n\n\n\\[\\begin{gather*}\n\\widehat{LifeExpectancy} = 33.120 + 1.162 * schooling - 0.63*HIV/AIDS \\\\ +  32.927*ICOR + 14.33*status -19.025*ICOR*status\\\\\nstatus =\n  \\begin{cases}\n    1 & \\text{if Developing Country}\\\\\n    0 & \\text{if Developed Country}\n  \\end{cases}\n\\end{gather*}\\]\nAIC Scores\nScore [1] is the AIC score for the interactive model, and score [2] is the AIC score for the additive model.\n\n\n[1] 9453.634\n\n\n[1] 9464.471\n\n\nBoth the additive and interactive models have similar AIC values.

    "text": "Results\nIn conclusion, we found that HIV/AIDs, Income Composition of Resources, and Schooling are the factors that have the greatest effect on the average life expectancy for a country in a given year, and this relationship holds true for both developing and developed countries.\nWe fit both an additive and interactive model to predict the average life expectancy of a country based on its HIV/AIDs deaths per 1,000 live births, Income Composition of Resources, Schooling, and Development Status. For our interactive model, we decided to add an interaction term between Income Composition of Resources and Development Status, because these two variables are likely to influence each other.\nWe also calculated the AIC scores for each model, which measure how well a given model fits the data with lower scores indicating a more appropriate model. The interactive and additive models have similar AIC values at 9453.634 and 9464.471, respectively. The interactive model has a lower AIC score, indicating that it is a more appropriate model for the data and a slightly better predictor of life expectancy than the additive model.\nIn the additive model, each predictor is added to the model individually, so the coefficient that comes out is the effect measured as if it were independent. The assumption made is that each factor has an independent effect on life expectancy. In the interactive model, there’s an “interaction term”, which examines the combined effect of income composition and a country’s development status on life expectancy. This allows us to measure how the relationship between income composition and life expectancy could be different in developing vs. developed countries, leading to a better fit model.\nModel interpretations\nSchooling:\n\nAdditive Model: The coefficient of schooling is 1.195, implying that, with all other variables constant, a one-year increase in schooling is correlated with about an increase of 1.195 years of life expectancy.\nInteractive model: The coefficient of schooling is 1.1624. Since in this model, schooling is not interacting with any other terms, it follows that the coefficient is similar to the additive model.\n\nHIV/AIDS:\n\nAdditive Model: The coefficient for HIV/AIDS is -0.6307, indicating that a unit increase in HIV/AIDS prevalence is associated with a decrease of 0.6307 years in life expectancy.\nInteractive model: The coefficient is -0.6327, which is close but slightly more negative. The coefficients are pretty close, indicating the impact HIV/AIDS prevalence has on life expectancy is similar in both models, which follows given it has no additional interaction in this model.\n\nIncome Composition of Resources:\n\nAdditive Model: The coefficient is 13.8667, meaning for each unit increase in the income composition of resources, life expectancy has a predicted increase of 13.8667 years.\nInteractive Model: The coefficient is 32.9267. The much-larger coefficient is part of an interaction term with development status. It indicates that, for example, the benefits of higher income composition are more positive in developing countries.\n\nDevelopment Status:\n\nAdditive Model: The coefficient is -1.4515, indicating that being a developing country is associated with a decrease of -1.4515 years of life expectancy. Essentially, developing countries have slightly lower life expectancy than developed countries.\nInteractive Model: The coefficient is 14.3391, meaning being a developing country is linked to an increase of life expectancy by 14.3391 years. The implication of the difference is that the disadvantage of development status is complex and varies based on income composition. High income composition can either mitigate or reverse the negative impact of being a developing country.\n\nScope of inference\nSince the World Health Organization life expectancy data was collected through observation, we can only conclude an associative relationship between HIV/AIDs, Income Composition of Resources, Schooling, and Development Status on life expectancy. We cannot conclude that these factors are causal.\nDiscussion\nThrough the course of this project, we’ve learned a lot about the factors that affect impact life expectancy, and how those trends differ between developing and developed countries. Some country factors, like schooling or HIV/AIDS prevalence, appear to have clearer positive or negative associations with life expectancy regardless of country status. However, other factors, such as the income composition of resources score, seem to be more greatly correlated with life expectancy for developing than developed countries. Although our limited scope of inference means that we cannot conclude the causation of any of these variables with life expectancy, it does provide some insight into possible avenues for improving population health that require further research and more robust statistical analysis. This can then better inform government policy making and procedures."

    "text": "Life expectancy and health disparities between developed and developing countries are complex issues with significant implications for global health. This project investigated the factors most significantly affecting life expectancy.\nThrough analysis of data from the World Health Organization, we found that HIV/AIDs, income composition of resources, and schooling have the greatest impact on life expectancy.

As stated by the World Health Organization, data is collected through household surveys, civil registrations, and institutional sources such as health facilities. This data is then curated into the Global Health Observatory database. The dataset has data from all countries collected from 2000 to 2015. Each observation is a country’s health status for a given year, and it includes variables such as life expectancy, mortality rates, country development status, schooling, disease rates, and alcohol rates."

Our hypothesis is that developed countries will on average have higher life expectancy than developing countries, and that the factors most correlated with life expectancy are immunization coverage and income composition of resources. There are both categorical and quantitative variables involved in our research topic. Development status is a categorical variable and immunization coverage, income composition of resources, disease rates, mortality rates, and schooling are quantitative variables. Life expectancy is a quantative variable."

Although life expectancy fluctuated more in the 20th century due to political circumstances, it had largely stabilized (for most countries) by the turn of the 21st century. Globally, the life expectancy for children born in 2015 was 71.4 years. However, for high-income countries, life expectancy is closer to 80 years or more, and for low-income countries, life expectancy is under 60 years. Despite dramatic gains in life expectancy in the last two decades, these major inequalities still persist. This report focuses on access to health services as a major determining factor for a nation’s life expectancy. Complications with pregnancy and childbirth, HIV incidence, malaria outbreak, cardiovascular disease, cancer, lack of clean water, etc. represent just some of these risk factors that stem from or are exacerbated by underlying issues with healthcare infrastructure.\nResearch Question: Our research question builds on the WHO article by determining which risk factors have the greatest, most direct impact on life expectancy for different countries. Additionally, the data set includes variables that are not directly mentioned in the article, so bringing more factors to the discussion regarding disparities in life expectancy provides us with a more nuanced outlook on the topic."

According to the Department of Agriculture, Arabica beans account for 60% of the coffee beans produced worldwide so there should be a higher quality if it is produced more.\nSource: https://usda.library.cornell.edu/usda/fas/tropprod//2010s/2017/tropprod-06-16-2017.pdf\nThe types of variables in my research question are both categorical and quantitative. For categorical variables, the Country of origin of the coffee bean, whether the bean is Robusta or Arabica, and region in which coffee bean is from. The qualitative variables is altitude of the farm in which the coffee bean is produced, the number of bags of the coffee bean produced, and the scores of the coffee bean for flavor, sweetness, acidity, fragrance, uniformity, and moisture (scale of 1-10 continuous)."

    "text": "Literature\nThe article I chose was “Arabic vs. Robusta: No Contest” by Jerry Baldwin which was featured in the Atlantic. In the article, Baldwin provides context as to why Arabica beans are better than Robusta beans that are supported by a historical breakdown of the origins of Arabica and Robusta beans. Specifically the creation of Robusta beans were to mix in with the Arabica beans to lower the overall cost of the beans per bag. Additionally, Baldwin provides context that Robusta beans are typically more mass-produced compared to Arabica, which often forgoes the quality and taste of the bean for making more. As a result, Baldwin concludes that Arabica beans have a better taste and quality than Robusta beans. However, Baldwin says that this is a generalization and may vary from bean to bean. Our research question builds on the article by expanding the data to more quantitative data rather than qualitative reasoning based on historical context. Our research question, instead, takes quantitative data of ratings of different factors that impact the quality of the bean (flavor, acidity, sweetness, etc) to see if there is a significant quantitative difference in ratings between Arabic and Robusta beans.\nLink: https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2009/06/arabica-vs-robusta-no-contest/19780/"

Most workers have experienced DEI measures at work, and most also say these measures have a positive impact, but not many place a lot of importance in it. Women are 11% more likely than men to see DEI as good, and in this order, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and then White people have the most positive opinions of DEI. The greatest indicator by far is political lean — Republicans are equally split between positive and negative opinions, while Democrats overwhelmingly support DEI. In terms of age groups, the general trend is that younger employed adults tend to have greater support of DEI. Workers under 30 show the greatest support — 68%, which generally declines into the 40s-50s in the upper age ranges. Workers generally believe their employer pays the right amount of attention to DEI. About 1/3 of workers believe racial or ethnic diversity and age diversity is important, with slightly less support for gender and sexual orientation diversity. About half of workers also value accessibility. Overall, workers that are women, Black, Democratic or young, tend to show the greatest support toward DEI.\nResearch Question: Our research question builds on this article, because the article indicates that the younger population supports workplace diversity more, and we want to figure out if the median age of a location is correlated with the minority ownership of businesses. Since younger demographics support diversity more, extrapolating from that, we would expect to see more minority ownership proportions in younger areas."
